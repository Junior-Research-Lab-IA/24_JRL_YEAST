# Objectives

We want to find two yeast species in order to :
* Decrease ethanol yield (with climate change, grapes have more and more sugar and wine, more and more ethanol)
* Broading the range of aromas (more diverse yeast could be equal to more diverse aromas)
* Managing acidity (again with climate change musts are more acidic)
